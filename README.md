**Characterizing Transport Properties of Nanofiltration Membranes**

This repository contains a Pyomo-based dynamic diafiltration model used to analyze the transport properties of nanofiltration (NF) membranes. It supports robust parameter estimation and data analytics workflows based on dynamic experiments.

## Environment Setup

This project is developed with the following dependencies:
- **Python**: Version 3.11.6
- **Pyomo**: Version 6.8.0
- **MATLAB**: Implemented with R2020a and R2022a (for additional MATLAB analysis in `DATA1-matlab`)

### Suggested Conda Configuration

To set up the Python environment, recommend the following Conda configuration:
```bash
conda create -n dynamic-diafiltration -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c IDAES-PSE python=3.11 numpy matplotlib pandas scipy idaes-pse scikit-learn
```
Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate dynamic-diafiltration
```
In case CasADi is not installed (needed for model initialization)
```bash
pip install casadi
```

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Diafiltration Modeling**: Captures startup dynamics, concentration-dependent transport properties, and solute flux mechanisms.
- **Data Analytics**: Implements advanced techniques like weighted least squares (WLS) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for parameter estimation and model discrimination.
- **Support for Multiple Membranes**: Includes NF90 (near neutral) and NF270 (negative-charged) membrane analysis for comparing transport properties.
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in scripts for generating model diagnostics and experiment comparisons.
- **FIM Analysis**: Calculates the Fisher Information Matrix for experimental design optimization.

## Usage

### Running the Model
1. **Prepare Data**: Place experimental `.mat` files in the `data/` directory.
2. **Configure Parameters**: Modify initial conditions and parameters in `utility.py` or the notebook as needed.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute `DATA2_model_demo.ipynb` to:
   - Load data.
   - Run the Pyomo model.
   - Visualize results.

### Visualization
Plots include:
- Time evolution of mass and concentration in vials.
- Comparison of experimental and simulated results.

### FIM Analysis
